# MedRead – AI-Powered Medical Report Analysis System 

## Final Year Project (FYP)

**MedRead** is an intelligent medical report analysis and decision-support system designed to assist healthcare professionals in interpreting **lung cancer–related medical reports**.
The system integrates **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Deep Learning (CNNs)**, and **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)** to automate report reading while maintaining transparency and trust.

---

## Problem Statement

Medical reports often contain **unstructured text and medical images**, making manual analysis:

* Time-consuming
* Prone to human error
* Difficult to scale

Existing AI solutions lack:

* Multimodal integration (text + images)
* Explainability required for clinical trust
* Robustness across formats and data sources

---

## Project Objectives

* Automatically **read and analyze medical reports**
* Extract **key diagnostic insights** from text and images
* Provide **explainable AI outputs** for clinicians
* Improve **efficiency, accuracy, and consistency**

---

##  Core Features

* **Medical Report Text Analysis**
  * NLP-based preprocessing and information extraction
    
* **Medical Image Processing**
  * CNN-based feature extraction from radiology images
  * 
* **Multimodal Data Fusion**
  * Combines text and image representations
    
* **Explainable AI (XAI)**
  * Interpretable predictions and reasoning
